# Haxxis

Haxxis is a configurable visualization renderer which allows the user to produce pre-configured instruction sets called Haxxis Packages.  These Haxxis Packages are used to turn input data into visuals.

Haxxis also has an in-built recording and choreography system which allows it to generate videos.  The choreography allows for hands-free control of the camera during video generation.

***

The Haxxis interface is segmented into three main components:
- The [Package Editor](#Basics/Manipulating%20the%20Package%20Editor.md) is where the user can create and modify the data processing side of the Package.
- The [Choreography](#Basics/Using%20the%20Choreography.md) is where the user can modify the choreography of the package.
- The [Renderer](#Basics/Manipulating%20the%20Renderer.md) is the space where the visualization is rendered, and is displayed behind the Workspace and the Choreography.

Haxxis uses a variety of keybinds.  View the [Readme](#includedreadme.md) to see the full list.
